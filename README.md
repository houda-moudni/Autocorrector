# Minimum Edit Distance Algorithm and Autocorrection From Scratch

This repository contains a project on Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on implementing the Minimum Edit Distance algorithm and creating an autocorrector in Python from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project explores key concepts in NLP, including:
1. **Minimum Edit Distance**: An algorithm to calculate the minimum transformations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to convert one string into another, optimized for autocorrection tasks.
2. **Autocorrection**: A spelling corrector using edit distance, language modeling, and error modeling for suggesting probable corrections.
   
***

### Minimum Edit Distance
- implement the edit distance function, integrate backtrace functionality for alignment and apply weighted costs based on QWERTY keyboard adjacency for spelling errors.

### Autocorrection
- Develop a basic spelling corrector using minimum edit distance.
- Implement optimization strategies: *filter by initial letter, word length, and phonetic code.*
- Enhance the corrector to prioritize probable corrections using Bayesian inference.

### Probabilistic Spelling Correction
- Implement functions to build a vocabulary and calculate word probabilities from a large corpus.
- Define `edits1`, `edits2`, and `knownWord` functions for candidate selection based on edit distance and probability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook (for notebook submission)
- Libraries: `re`
